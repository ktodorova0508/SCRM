> The project consist of manual test cases for the Digital Leaflet of the LIDL Plus app. The project tends to check the quality of the product.


NB! In order to check the actual app I used the VPN app for Android and set my phone's fake location to Zaragoza because the app
is not available in Bulgaria and I wasn't able to download the app if my location is stated to Bulgaria. After downloading the Lidl Plus app
I set the store location to Zaragoza - Zar-Avda store and checked all the posibilities I have in the app. After checking any leaflet
there was no option to click on a certain product product details including its photo, availability and description. Also I didn't
find any floating button in order to see the date filters and the filter for the concrete promotions. As described in file:
"If you download the app, you’ll see only the Digital Leaflet available for Zaragoza stores." In order to derive detailed test cases
one needs to be able to check the actual feature or to have a detailed specificatons/requirements list which will give information such as:
1. If the date filters are fields with free text option or there are available drop down calendars from which a date should be chosen.
2. The date format.
3. The structure of the certain promotion filter like is the list of the promotions a drop down menu or radio button or checkboxes.
4. When clicking on a certain product should the description open in the same page or in a new page in order to know if there is API to test.
5. The structure of the database or at least the tables which consist of the surtido and the tables for the certain period of time
in order to check if what is visible in the UI matches the database data.
